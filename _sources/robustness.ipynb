    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The [QuantEcon.py](http://quantecon.org/quantecon-py) package provides a class called `RBLQ` for implementation of robust LQ optimal control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/blob/master/quantecon/robustlq.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief description of the methods of the class\n",
    "\n",
    "* `d_operator()` and `b_operator()` implement $\\mathcal D$\n",
    "  and $\\mathcal B$ respectively\n",
    "* `robust_rule()` and `robust_rule_simple()` both solve for the\n",
    "  triple $\\hat F, \\hat K, \\hat P$, as described in equations {eq}`rb_oc_ih` -- {eq}`rb_kd` and the surrounding discussion\n",
    "    * `robust_rule()` is more efficient\n",
    "    * `robust_rule_simple()` is more transparent and easier to follow\n",
    "* `K_to_F()` and `F_to_K()` solve the decision problems\n",
    "  of {ref}`agent 1 <rb_a1>` and {ref}`agent 2 <rb_a2>` respectively\n",
    "* `compute_deterministic_entropy()` computes the left-hand side of {eq}`rb_pdt`\n",
